Congratulations! You have successfully completed the cloud_breach_s3 scenario!

You exploited:
1. A misconfigured reverse proxy server
2. Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) exposure
3. Overly permissive IAM role attached to EC2

Key Takeaways:
- Always use IMDSv2 with session tokens
- Configure reverse proxies to only allow specific Host headers
- Apply least privilege principle to IAM roles
- Use VPC endpoints for S3 access
